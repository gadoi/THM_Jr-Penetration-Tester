Task 5 SSRF Practical 
We've come across two new endpoints during a content discovery exercise against the Acme IT Support website. The first one is /private, which gives us an error message explaining that the contents cannot be viewed from our IP address. The second is a new version of the customer account page at /customers/new-account-page with a new feature allowing customers to choose an avatar for their account.

Begin by clicking the Start Machine button to launch the Acme IT Support website. Once running, visit it at the URL https://LAB_WEB_URL.p.thmlabs.com and then follow the below instructions to get the flag.

First, create a customer account and sign in. Once you've signed in, visit https://LAB_WEB_URL.p.thmlabs.com/customers/new-account-page to view the new avatar selection feature. By viewing the page source of the avatar form, you'll see the avatar form field value contains the path to the image. The background-image style can confirm this in the above DIV element as per the screenshot below:

If you choose one of the avatars and then click the Update Avatar button, you'll see the form change and, above it, display your currently selected avatar. Viewing the page source will show your current avatar is displayed using the data URI scheme, and the image content is base64 encoded as per the screenshot below.



What is the flag from the /private directory?
